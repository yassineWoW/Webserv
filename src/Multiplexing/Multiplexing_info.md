So Let’s summarize the difference between select, poll, and epoll for I/O multiplexing. The select and poll should pass all the descriptors to the kernel to know what file descriptors the process can handle. On the other hand, the process only asks for the epoll instance without full file descriptors once the process enrolled them before. So kernel doesn’t need to scan all the file descriptors whenever the request comes from the process with an epoll instance.
